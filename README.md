- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @icubud
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... have a wide range of subject interests. I enjoy music, movies and TV...
I enjoy reading and have a W I D E range of interest.
I am a COLLECTOR of wise words, beauty, photos, scraps, inspiration and happiness. I love boxes, leather goods, journals, pens, BOOKS, vests, bags, ephemera and rings. I am an avid re-user/re-purposer of packaging and mailing materials - really anything -- and no I am not a hoarder.
I have a great love for bunnies and cubs.
Spiritually I consider myself a saved Bible believer but so as to hopefully avoid some of the stigma that is heavily steeped on anyone who does not designate a denomination, I must consider myself an independent saved Bible-believing Baptist. But Baptist denominations are highly polluted with leaven and such. I am a Christian in the true definition of the word which is given in Acts 11:26. Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Catholicism are NOT Christian. R.C. has been a great and successful tool in 1) making people not want to be a Christian and 2) making the majority of its believers/followers/members die and go to hell. I have great concern for everyone's present, temporal state of things and the future, eternal state of things.
Matt 16:26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Politically I consider myself an independent, that unfortunately due to the limited choices, usually votes Republican. I am praying for legitimate third and fourth parties to gain traction in our society so that they will provide some better candidates. I am hoping for a bloodless American Spring. I believe some of the greatest detriments to our society here in the USA is the MSM (mainstream media), the judicial system and Congress. MAGA!! WWG1WGA #45=#47; #17.
Our country needs to make term limits for those who hold a seat in Congress. The individual can not serve more than 8 years in their life in any capacity of Congress. And yes I voted for Trump both times and will do so again.
I am 56, married 30 years and we have no children by design and intent. I have earned a MBA with distinction and now that I have the whole grad school thing behind me (as of 6/26/11), I am trying to resume my writing, painting and drawing. I am also a former adjunct professor in the business & economic program of a major university where we live. I taught in the evenings. (In 2016 I quit adjunct teaching due to a couple things: one,what ended up being my hourly pay wage was around two dollars an hour. Secondly, the anxiety and angst of successfully teaching the class drowned me to the point I was a miserable ball of nerves.) I am wonderfully employed during the day as an Epic Clarity report writer & data analyst for a major health-care organization where we live. I thank You God for this wonderful opportunity and for all things He has given me AND not given me.
I am a hopeless romantic.
I am Linux not Windows/Apple.
I am laptop not desktop.
I am a lover of real tangible books AND Kindle/Adobe Reader books and audiobooks. Me just love books :O)
I prefer quiet over noise.
My Strength Finders results are: input, achiever, learner, intellectual, context
